## Hyper-colateralizated syntectic assets on Bitcoin through Lombard Credit via Discreet Log Contracts

### 1. Issue

Bitcoin is often pointed as a strong candidate to become the world-wide reserve currency. However, though it has become one of the main assets used as store of value, it is not yet adopted worldwide as a mean of exchange. The explanation to this fenomenon can be split in two aspects:

#### 1.1 Currency paradox (Saving Paradox)

Derived from Gresham's Law, comes the "Currency Paradox":

"_Ceteris Paribus_, rational agents prefer spend currencies with low potential as store of value, while they tend to accumulate currencies with greater potential as a store of value for future exchanges."

For example, if an rational agent receives half of it's salary in dollars, and the other half in venezuelan bolívars, your rational atitude is to spend first the venezuelan bolívars and reserve the dollars for future exchanges, once this one can, relatively, keep its value better through time.

Bitcoin, being the less inflationary currency existent and with greater potential as store of value through time, tends to be accumulated, and not spend, reducing its using as a mean of exchange.

#### 1.3 Layered Money

The direct using of Bitcoin as a store of value and mean of exchange violates the concept of Layered Money, elaborated extensively on the Allan Schramm's article "Bitcoin, the system of final settlement." and the book "Layered Money" from Nik Bhatia. Gold wasn't used extensivelly as a mean of exchange, but through layers that made it usefull as a mean of exchange.

Observing the evolution of the using of gold as the basis of the monetary system, it's possible to divide it in four layers: the first being the metal itself after extraction, gold nuggets in their original form. The second layer is the standardization of this material into gold bars that follow high standards of purity, shape, measurement and weight. The third is gold certificates, where these bars, difficult to transport and divide, were "tokenized". The fourth layer is the banknotes as they were known before the end of the gold standard, backed by these certificates that circulate en masse.

Each of these layers have distinct attributes and focuses to perform their respective functions. The notion that Bitcoin in it's raw form would maximize all the needed caracteristics of a monetary system (store of value, mean of exchange and unit of account) does not allign with the history of money in humanity.

If we wish Bitcoin to be used as a mean of exchange, we need to recognize this currency paradox and the concept of layered money so we can create a Bitcoin-based monetary system that supplies the market demands.

#### 2 Current sollutions

#### 2.1 Centralized Stablecoins (IOU)

The IOU Stablecoins are assets in which it's value derives from being backed by Fiat reserves or other traditional assets kept by a centralized entity. Examples includes Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) and DePix. Those stablecoins are essentially tokenized promisory notes issued by private companies, i.e., they carry a significant counterpart risk as you lose custody of your bitcoins, and you need to trust the company that issues them that they keep honestly complete reserves, and that will redeem tokens as promised.

Previous cases of lack of transparency and imcomplete audits eroded the trust with scams and bad using of the colateral, resulting in the loss of parity of the token. In addition, those centralized stablecoins are suceptible to governamental regulations and can be censured or closed at any time.

Despite of the mentioned issues, they are extensivelly used: Theter (USDT) is the third greatest criptocurrency, and is heavilly used as a mean of exchange in third world countries as a tokenized dollar.

#### 2.2 Algorithmic Stablecoins

Contrasting with the IOU Stablecoins, which reintroduce the centralized counterpart risk, Algorithmic Stablecoins doesn't have a centralized issuer or Fiat reserves. They are backed by a digital asset, and the conversion is performed by smart contracts. Some examples are the USD of 10101, MakerDAO and TerraUSD.

Although they have clear advantages over IOU Stablecoins, they have a giant additional cost: hypercolateralization. All of them require a greater backing collateral than the equivalent value of the fiat stablecoin issued. In addition, the user must have tecnical knowledge of the specific algorithm used to keep that parity, which is different for each currency, and also knowledge of the digital asset used as collateral.

In this way, to the avegare user, the risk perception is high, as these ventures do not follow a standard protocol with a standard asset as reserve. In the case of TerraUSD, the risk was so high that it collapsed: the collateral used were weak assets in which it's value was linked to the protocol itself. For this user, using a centralized and legal solution is safer than an unknown one to him, even with a supposedly safer mechanism. 

The the average user, this cost is greater than the benefits of using a centralized stablecoin, which has a cost of 1:1, instead of a cost of, let's say, 2:1 required to generate the hypercollateralization of algorithmic stablecoins. The average user prefers to take the temporary risk of Tether not succumbing rather than spending capital to create the collateral. The entire focus of these protocols is to create fiat currencies and compete directly with IOUs, using their own mechanisms, which we believe is not a viable market strategy.

NITI has a different strategy: create a universal protocol for creating stablecoins by the users themselves, focused in assets that centralized stablecoins cannot create.

#### 2.3 NITI's Proposal

NITI proposes to implement the monetary system that Hayek has proposed in 1976, in the book "The Denationalization of Money", creating a platform where various stablecoins can compete freely, following all the same protocol to ensure it's quality.

#### 2.3.1 Hayek's Monetary Model and NITI's Implementation

In his book "The Denationalization of Money", published in 1976, the economist Friedrich Hayek proposed a new monetary system. He argued that the State Monopoly over currency issuance is the root of many problems, such as inflation, boom and bust cycles, and monetary crisis. Hayek stated that the final solution is to allow free competition on issuing private currencies.

In this model, private institutions can now emit it's own currencies, which can now freely circulate on the market. The users would choose the currencies they consider more stable and trustful. Currencies that did not maintain their value would lose public confidence and be abandoned in favor of better alternatives.

According to Hayek, this monetary competition system would take to more stable currencies and adjusted to the market demands. Issuing institutions would have strong incentives to keep the value of it's currencies, 'cause their reputation and business would depend on that. They would seek to meet user's demands for currencies with different characteristics, such as greater or less stability, backing in different assets, etc.

NITI proposes to implement this Hayek model using Discreet Log Contracts technology on Bitcoin (DLC's). Through DLC's, any person or institution can create a Algorithimic Stablecoin (called "Synthetic assets" in NITI's terminology) backed by a variety of assets, way beyond what traditional stablecoins backed by fiat currencies can offer.

This synthetic assets could have their value linked to commodities, stocks, indexes, fees or any other asset with a public and verifiable price. Each emitter could now choose the basket of assets to use as collateral on your synthetic asset, seeking to serve specific market niches. The users can, for instance, choose the synthetic assets that fullfils better it's personal needs of stability, hedge, exposure to specific sectors, etc.

Differently of current algorithmic stablecoins, that has each one it's own complex and risky mechanisms of stabilization, all NITI's synthetic assets will follow the same pattern model using DLC's. It will bring transparency, security and usability to users. They will know that all synthetic asset, independently of who is the issuer, follow the same operating logic.

Therefore, NITI seeks to create the technological basis to make viable the monetary competition model proposed by Hayek. It will be a huge step towards the Denationalization of Money as glimpsed by Hayek decades ago.

#### 2.3.2 Token diversity

Instead of directly competing with IOU's, our proposal is to implement something that they're unable to do by it's own nature: token diversity. Tether has direct reserves for its backing and this is possible because of the high liquidity on the traditional market of dollars, future contracts, treasure bills, etc. Meanwhile, if they wanted to create a token that emulates the Diesel price, which would be very useful to truck drivers to have a hedge agains its own costs, they would find it very difficult. They can try to use fuel stocks as backing, but it has high costs and it would make unfeasable the monetization of this reserves. It may be even possible to create a dynamic basket of traditional assets to emulate this price, but it is possible to see how this system would rapdly increase in complexity and reduce its profitability.

In the case of creating a stablecoin that is pegged to the variarion in the transaction fee rate (sats/vB) on Bitcoin, there are no legal instruments in the traditional financial market to create, or monetize this reserves. This type of stablecoin can't be created through IOU's, and we believe that it is in this type of asset that algorithmic stablecoins have a competitive advantage.

Niti's synthetic assets can be pegged to climate variations, harvest volume, political events, transaction fees on Bitcoin, price averages (E. G.: mean price of Bitcoin in the last 200 weeks), stock indexes and any other assets with public data and trustable information sources and which the two parties of the contract rely on. Diferently of the IOU stablecoins, its system do not rely on direct backing, but only a private contract between two parties which uses bitcoin as collateral, allowing specfic synthetic assets to be created for specific and peculiar cases. Niti found this gap in the market, as although algorithimic stablecoins have the technical ability to generate tokens of anything that has public prices, they focus on copying fiat currencies and competing with IOU stablecoins.

#### 2.3.3 Standardization

Algorithmic stablecoins present high complexity to users as they follow their individual protocols, which can be flawed, as was the case with TerraUSD. The user then needs to specifically study that process in depth to undestand these risks and economically analize the viability of the parity of the offered tokens. This is unfeasible to the average user, who in practice takes a high risk when participating in a system that he doesn't know and is unique to that protocol.

In the solution proposed by Hayek, distinct private currencies would compete freely on the private market. He argues that our view of using a single currency based on the custom of the state monopoly, and we should use various synthetic assets (stablecoins with no direct backing), based on various asset baskets to the distinc uses of money. Niti has the objective of bringing this system to life, with over 50 years after its conception. So, Niti is not a bank offering stablecoins, but it is actually a protocol where market agents can use it to create their own stablecoins, that necessarily need to adhere to the protocol model

This way, using companies that follow Niti protocol to create these stablecoins, the customer know he is using a safe platform, indenpendently of which token he is buying. With the standardization of algorithmic stablecoins, the complexity and the risk perception is highly reduced to the customer. TerraUSD would never operate on Niti, because its system could not follow the standard protocol accepted and known by everyone. Niti uses the Blue Ocean Strategy a new value proposal not yet used by any algorithmic stablecoin.

#### 2.3.4 Niti's Blue Ocean Strategy

According to KIM and MALBORGNE (2008), strategies such as Blue Ocean seek to create uncontested market spaces, as oposing to competition in an existing space. Focuses on making the competition irrelevant, and doesn't necessarilly care about beating it, because the company that uses the Blue Ocean Strategy compete for different customers, in a wider market, with different value proposals of what is offered on the market. The tools used on this research consists on the Matrix of Value Evaluation, which serves as a basis for diagnosing the company as a model for developing a new strategy; the Model of the four actions, used to question the business model used by competitors and propose changes on the company value curve; and the Matrix of eliminating-reduce-elevate-create, a complementar model to the four actions model and comunicate the needed actions to achieve the new value curve proposed by the strategy.

#### 2.3.4 The current analysis

#### Value Evaluation Matrix

![Value Evaluation Matrix](./assets/matrix1.jpg)

#### Model of the four actions

According to the four questions strategic questions developed by Kim and Mauborgne (2008), it is essential to determine which sector attributes should be changed:

**Which attributes considered indispensable by the sector should be eliminated?**

Niti eliminates the individual separation of tokenization services, acting as a protocol and technological infrastructure that allows other actors to create and monetize their own synthetic assets. Unlike platforms like MakerDAO, which operate with proprietary systems, Niti will position itself as an open platform, allowing others to operate on top of it. Currently, all stablecoin providers develop their own smart contracts and restrict access to their platforms. Niti will eliminate this barrier, promoting total openness.

**Which attributes should be reduced well below industry standards?**

Niti plans to reduce significantly the Capital Expendure (CapEx) comparing to other algorithmic stablecoins, in addition to decrease the amount of digital assets needed to stablish the backing of stablecoins. The platform will use exclusivelly Bitcoin as backing, simplifying the process and reducing the operational costs.

### 3. Model

#### 3.1 Discreet Log Contracts

Discreet Log Contracts (DLCS) are a kinda smart contract on Bitcoin that allows two parties to make bets or agreements privately, using real-world data to determine the outcome. It operates similarly to the Lightning Network but with conditional payment channels instead of off-chain micropayment channels.

![DLC Model](/pt-br/assets/modeloDLC.png)
*Interdax, “Discreet Log Contracts: Scalable Smart Contracts for Bitcoin”*


DLCs use a model similar to the Lightning Network. Instead of being used for generic payments through a payment channel, they use a channel for conditional payments depending on external data to be executed.

#### 3.2 How NITI uses DLCs to implement Hayek's monetary system

NITI is not Alice, neither is Bob, nor the Oracle. NITI acts as a coordinator between these parts, providing a technology infrastructure so Alice and Bob can meet and choose an oracle with a high reputation. It involves overcoming challenges cited in the Discreet Log Contracts Whitepaper: “Decentralized Matching“ or Decentralized Pairing.

<!-- TODO: Write section 3.2.1 -->
#### 3.2.1 Decentralized Pairing

NITI uses decentralized communication protocols, such as Nostr, to facilitate the pairing between parties interested in creating a DLC contract (Alice and Bob) and the oracle that will provide the external data necessary for the execution of the contract.

Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a open and decentralized protocol for online communication. It allows users to publish content, interact and exchange messages on a safe and private way, without needing centralized platforms. On Nostr, the users maintain full control over their identities and data, using public key cryptography.

Through Nostr, Alice and Bob can publish their intentions of making a contract in encrypted form, specifying the desired terms (asset, expiration date, pricing ranges, etc). These assets stay visible to other users on Nostr, who can then express interest if they have compatible intent. Once Alice and Bob meet and verify that their interest are complementary, they can then proceed with the creation of the DLC contract itself.

Besides, Niti also keep a list of trustable oracles on Nostr, oracles that publish periodically and permanently their data, having its reputation based on the precision and frequency that this data are transmitted. Alice and Bob can then choose between a set of those oracles to provide the external data needed to the execution of the DLC Contract. This choice is crucial, because the integrity and precision of the data provided by the oracle are fundamental to the smooth operation of the contract.

All this pairing process happens on a descentralized way, without Alice and Bob needing to trust their info to intermediaries. Nostr acts only as a intermediator, alowing the parties to meet each other and choose an oracle eficiently and privately.

Beyond facilitating the descentralized pairing between Alice, Bob and an oracle mutually trusted Oracle, the Nostr also allows Niti to interlink multiple Discreet Log Contracts in sequency or in cascade. This arquitecture allows the creation of complex financial instruments and automated in Bitcoin. The central ideal is that the verified result of a DLC can serve automatically as a trigger to another DLC preconfigured by the parties, thus creating a chain of conditionally interkinked contracts.

<!-- TODO: Finish section 3.2.1 -->

#### 3.2.3 Use of Multiple Collateral for DLCs

DLCs commonly use only a digital asset as collateral, especially bitcoin. However, NITI employs Lombard Loans, which allows for utilizing a diversified basket of Bitcoin-backed synthetic assets as collateral.

This approach brings significant advantages, as Bitcoin is an extremely volatile asset. By diversifying collateral with other uncorrelated synthetic assets, such as gold, the dollar, stocks, etc., the overall volatility of the collateral basket is reduced, mitigating the risk of margin calls.

#### 3.2.3.1 Lombard Credit

Lombard Loans, or Lombard Credits, is a traditional modality of loans where liquid assets are used as guarantees or collateral. Traditionally, it is offered by private banks to clients of hight income, Lombard Loans allows that borrowers to acess liquidity without having to sell their assets.

<!-- Maybe don't be TITLES (Line 122) -->
On the traditional market, a Lombard Loan works as follows: the client uses its assets (stocks, titles, funds) as collateral to the borrow. So, the bank lends an amount in money based on percent of the value of these assets in guarantees. The client pays fees periodically on borrowed value. If the value of the assets pledged as collateral falls below a pre-determined threshold about the loan amount, a margin call occurs. In this scenario, the client must deposit additional assets as collateral to replenish the required margin of guarantees by the bank. Failure to restore this margin will prompt the bank to execute or liquidate the initially provided collateral assets to repay the loan.

Within Niti's platform, Lombard Loans are used to create synthetic assets backed by multiple assets. For example, Alice could use a combination of:
  - 1/3 of a Gold Synthetic
  - 1/3 of a Dollar Synthetic
  - 1/3 of Bitcoin

Furthermore, the users can create collateral custom baskets that best suit their risk profile and expectations for a specific contract.

In Value-at-Risk (VaR) analyses, it was possible to quantify the benefits of diversification in reducing risk when using multiple assets as collateral. Using only Bitcoin as collateral, using one day as a period, 99% confidence, and daily data from 2014, the amount at risk of being lost is 8.25%. With just the dollar as collateral, it is 1.81%, and with just gold, it is 2.14%. Now, using the three assets together, in the proportion of each 1/3, there is the lowest risk of all: just 1%. Although it seems counterintuitive, this occurs because the prices of these assets have a low correlation: they tend to rise and fall at different times. Empirically, it is mathematically proven that using multiple assets as collateral is eight times safer than using only Bitcoin.

#### 4 Use cases

#### 4.1 Sinthetic Real

Using Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), Niti allows the creation of stablecoins which replicate the value of fiat currencies as Brazilian Real. This application is particulally usefull in markets where the volatility or devaluation of the local currency makes the stability offered by a cryptocurrency pegged to the value of more stable currencies attractive.

#### 4.2 Descentralized DCA

Dollar Cost Averaging Strategy (DCA) is facilitated by the use of DLC's interlinked on Niti's protocol, allowing automatic and periodic purchases of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This system sets up a new DLC periodically, where the price of the asset is determined by the result of the last DLC.

#### 4.3 Synthetic Stocks

Niti also allows the creation of synthetic stocks which emulates the development of a stock or indexes from the stock market. These synthetics are created and managed through DLC's, allowing users an exposition to different financial markets without the need of directly convert your cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies or invest directly on external markets.

#### 4.4 Passive income in Bitcoin

Through the use of multiple assets as collateral, Niti allows not only the creation of synthetic assets, but also the renting of those assets to other users. This creates a opportunity of passive income to Bitcoin owners that wish to monetize its assets without selling them, renting them as collateral on DLC contracts.

#### 4.5 P2P bettings

Niti's protocol uses Discreet Contract Logs (DLCs) to organize peer-to-peer bets on a variety of events, such as sportive, political or other noticeable events. This allows users to bet directly with each other, without the need of betting houses or other intermediaries. By using oracles to confirm the result of events, the protocol ensures that the bets are solved fairly and transparently. For example, on a sport bet, users can bet on some result on a soccer match; on a political bet, the focus can be the result of elections. Each bet is ensured by smart contracts that only release the payment when the result is officially confirmed by the oracle.

#### 4.7 Simplified Hedge

A Farmer faces various variable costs on its operations, such as fuel, fertilizers, seeds, animal food and others. These inputs have publicly negotiates prices on commodities markets.

Through Niti, the farmer can buy a set of synthetic assets that follow the price of these inputs on a specific proportion. For example:

- 30% Diesel Synthetic
- 25% Soy Synthetic
- 20% Nitrogen Fertilizer Synthetic
- 15% Corn Synthetic
- 10% Fosfate Synthetic

This set of synthetics would form a simplified hedge against the main source of variable costs of the farm. As the prices of those inputs fluctuate, the value of the corresponding synthetic assets also fluctuate, providing a natural hedge.

The farmer don't need to negotiate directly these assets on the traditional markets of commodities. Through Niti DLC's, he can obtain facilitated exposure to a personalized basket of those assets, backed by bitcoin.

Furthermore, as the synthetic assets are negotiates on a descentralized peer-to-peer way, the farmer can keep total custody of its funds during all process, without needing to exchange it with a centralized counterpart.

This kind of simplified hedge without custody would be very hard or expensive of obtain on the traditional market to a small rural producer. However, Niti allows even farmers to build personalized protection strategies against price fluctuations in a practical and economical way.

The capability of creating synthetic assets backed by pratically any asset with public price that makes Niti a powerfull solution to manage the risk on various sectors, not only the financial. Producers, companies and even natural persons can assemble their own baskets of hedge, according with its specific needs.
